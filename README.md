# Rag_pipeline
This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline designed to enhance large language models (LLMs) with relevant, real-time information. Built using LangChain and a simple Streamlit UI, it enables users to upload documents, build contextual understanding, and interact with LLMs using accurate and dynamic responses.
